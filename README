NAME
    DataFlow - A framework for dataflow processing

VERSION
    version 0.91.05

SYNOPSIS
            use DataFlow::Node;
            use DataFlow::Chain;

            my $chain = DataFlow::Chain->new(
                    DataFlow::Node->new(
                            process_item => sub {
                                    ... do something
                            }
                    ),
                    DataFlow::Node->new(
                            process_item => sub {
                                    ... do something else
                            }
                    ),
            );

            my $output = $chain->process($input);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a framework for data flow processing. It started as a spinoff
    project from OpenData-BR <http://www.opendatabr.org/>.

    As of now (Feb, 2011) it is still a 'work in progress', and there is a
    lot of progress to make. It is highly recommended that you read the
    tests, and also the documentation for DataFlow::Node and
    DataFlow::Chain, to start with.
