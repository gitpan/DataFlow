NAME
    DataFlow - A framework for dataflow processing

VERSION
    version 0.91.10

SYNOPSIS
            use DataFlow::Node;
            use DataFlow::Chain;

            my $chain = DataFlow::Chain->new(
                    DataFlow::Node->new(
                            process_item => sub {
                                    ... do something
                            }
                    ),
                    DataFlow::Node->new(
                            process_item => sub {
                                    ... do something else
                            }
                    ),
            );

            my $output = $chain->process($input);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a framework for data flow processing. It started as a spinoff
    project from OpenData-BR <http://www.opendatabr.org/>.

    As of now (Mar, 2011) it is still a 'work in progress', and there is a
    lot of progress to make. It is highly recommended that you read the
    tests, and also the documentation for DataFlow::Node and
    DataFlow::Chain, to start with.

    An article has been recently written in Brazilian Portuguese about this
    framework, per the São Paulo Perl Mongers "Equinócio" (Equinox) virtual
    event. Although an English version of the article in in the plans, you
    can figure a good deal out of the original one at

    Any doubts, feel free to get in touch.
