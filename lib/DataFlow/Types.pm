=head1 NAME

DataFlow::Types - Type definitions for DataFlow

=head1 VERSION

version 1.111860

=head1 SYNOPSIS

When defining a Moose attribute. Example:

       has 'direction' => (
           is  => 'ro',
           isa => 'ConversionDirection',
       );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains only type definitions. Most of the time there will be
no need to work or mess with this code, unless there is a bug in DataFlow
and/or you are developing a new feature which requires a new type or an
adjustment to an existing one.

=head1 SUBTYPES

=head2 Processor

A L<DataFlow::Proc> object, with coercions.

=head3 Coercions

=head4 from Str

Named processors. If it contains the substring '::', DataFlow will try to
create an object of that type. If it does not, then DataFlow will attempt to
create an object of the type C<< DataFlow::Proc::<STRING> >>. The string 'Proc'
is reserved for creating an object of the type <DataFlow::Proc>.

=head4 from ArrayRef

Named processor with parameters. The first element of the array must be a
text string, subject to the rules used in the previous item. The rest of the
array is passed as-is for the constructor of the object.

=head4 from CodeRef

Code reference, a.k.a. a C<sub>. A processor object will be created:

    DataFlow::Proc->new( p => CODE )

=head4 from DataFlow::Role::Processor

An object that can B<process> something. Objects from both L<DataFlow> and
L<DataFlow::Proc> classes will consume that role, so will all its descendants.
If the element is blessed and C<< ->does('DataFlow::Role::Processor') >>, a
processor object will be created wrapping it:

    DataFlow::Proc->new( p => sub { PROCESSOR->process($_) } )

=head2 ProcessorList

An ArrayRef of L<DataFlow::Proc> objects, with at least one element.

=head3 Coercions

=head4 from ArrayRef

Attempts to make DataFlow::Proc objects out of different things provided in
an ArrayRef. It currently works for:

=over 4

=item *

Str

=item *

ArrayRef

=item *

CodeRef

=item *

DataFlow::Role::Processor

=back

using the same rules as in the subtype C<Processor> described above.
Anything else will trigger an error.

=head4 from Str

An ArrayRef will be created wrapping a named processor, as described in the
coercion section of the C<Processor> subtype above.

=head4 from CodeRef

An ArrayRef will be created wrapping a processor, as described in the
coercion section of the C<Processor> subtype above.

=head4 from DataFlow::Role::Processor

An ArrayRef will be created wrapping the processor, as described in the
coercion section of the C<Processor> subtype above.

=head2 ProcessorSub

A CodeRef, with coercions.

=head3 Coercions

=head4 from DataFlow::Role::Processor

An ArrayRef will be created wrapping the processor.
The rules used above for DataFlow::Role::Processor elements in the ArrayRef
apply.

=head2 ConversionDirection

An enumeration used by type L<DataFlow::Proc::Converter>,
containing two elements:

=over 4

=item *

CONVERT_TO

Indicates the conversion will occur towards a specified type

=item *

CONVERT_FROM

Conversely, indicates the conversion will occur from a specfied type

=back

See DataFlow::Proc::Converter for more information.

=head2 ConversionSubs

A HashRef[CodeRef] also used by DataFlow::Proc::Converter. It must have two
keys only, 'CONVERT_TO' and 'CONVERT_FROM', holding a code reference (sub) for
each of those.

See DataFlow::Proc::Converter for more information.

=head2 Decoder

A CodeRef used by L<DataFlow::Proc::Encoding>. It will be used to decode
strings from some particular character encoding to Perl's internal
representation.

=head3 Coercions

=head4 from Str

It will automagically create a C<sub> that uses function C<< decode() >> from
module L<Encode> to decode from a named encoding.

=head2 Encoder

A CodeRef used by L<DataFlow::Proc::Encoding>. It will be used to encode
strings from Perl's internal representation to some particular character
encoding.

=head3 Coercions

=head4 from Str

It will automagically create a C<sub> that uses function C<< encode() >> from
module L<Encode> to encode to a named encoding.
