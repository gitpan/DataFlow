=head1 NAME

DataFlow - A framework for dataflow processing

=head1 VERSION

version 1.112100

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use DataFlow;

	my $flow = DataFlow->new(
		procs => [
		    DataFlow::Proc->new( p => sub { do this thing } ), # a Proc
			sub { ... do something },   # a code ref
			'UC',                       # named Proc
			[                           # named Proc, with parameters
			  CSV => {
				direction     => 'CONVERT_TO',
				text_csv_opts => { binary => 1 },
			  }
			],
			# named Proc, named "Proc"
			[ Proc => { p => sub { do this other thing }, deref => 1 } ],
			DataFlow->new( ... ),       # another flow
		]
	);

	$flow->input( <some input> );
	my $output = $flow->output();

	my $output = $flow->output( <some other input> );

	# other ways to invoke the constructor
	my $flow = DataFlow->new( sub { .. do something } );   # pass a sub
	my $flow = DataFlow->new( [                            # pass an array
		sub { ... do this },
		'UC',
		[
		  HTMLFilter => (
		    search_xpath => '//td',
			result_type  => 'VALUE'
		  )
		]
	] );
	my $flow = DataFlow->new( $another_flow ); # pass another DataFlow or Proc

	# other way to pass the data through
	my $output = $flow->process( qw/long list of data/ );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<DataFlow> object is able to accept data, feed it into an array of
processors (L<DataFlow::Proc> objects), and return the result(s) back to the
caller.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 name

(Str) A descriptive name for the dataflow. (OPTIONAL)

=head2 default_channel

(Str) The name of the default communication channel. (DEFAULT: 'default')

=head2 auto_process

(Bool) If there is data available in the output queue, and one calls the
C<output()> method, this attribute will flag whether the dataflow should
attempt to automatically process queued data. (DEFAULT: true)

=head2 procs

(ArrayRef[DataFlow::Role::Processor]) The list of processors that make this
DataFlow. Optionally, you may pass CodeRefs that will be automatically
converted to L<DataFlow::Proc> objects. (REQUIRED)

The C<procs> parameter will accept some variations in its value. Any
C<ArrayRef> passed will be parsed, and additionaly to plain
C<DataFlow::Proc> objects, it will accept: C<DataFlow> objects (so one can
nest flows), code references (C<sub{}> blocks), array references and plain
text strings. Refer to L<DataFlow::Types> for more information on these
different forms of passing the C<procs> parameter.

Additionally, one may pass any of these forms as a single argument to the
constructor C<new>, plus a single C<DataFlow>, or C<DataFlow:Proc> or string.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 has_queued_data

Returns true if the dataflow contains any queued data within.

=head2 clone

Returns another instance of a C<DataFlow> using the same array of processors.

=head2 input

Accepts input data for the data flow. It will gladly accept anything passed as
parameters. However, it must be noticed that it will not be able to make a
distinction between arrays and hashes. Both forms below will render the exact
same results:

	$flow->input( qw/all the simple things/ );
	$flow->input( all => 'the', simple => 'things' );

If you do want to handle arrays and hashes differently, we strongly suggest
that you use references:

	$flow->input( [ qw/all the simple things/ ] );
	$flow->input( { all => the, simple => 'things' } );

Processors using the L<DataFlow::Policy::ProcessInto> policy (default) will
process the items inside an array reference, and the values (not the keys)
inside a hash reference.

=head2 channel_input

Accepts input data into a specific channel for the data flow:

	$flow->channel_input( 'mydatachannel', qw/all the simple things/ );

=head2 process_input

Processes items in the array of queues and place at least one item in the
output (last) queue. One will typically call this to flush out some unwanted
data and/or if C<auto_process> has been disabled.

=head2 output_items

Fetches items, more specifically objects of the type L<DataFlow::Item>, from
the data flow. If called in scalar context it will return one processed item
from the flow. If called in list context it will return all the items from
the last queue.

=head2 output

Fetches data from the data flow. It accepts a parameter that points from which
data channel the data must be fetched. If no channel is specified, it will
default to the 'default' channel.
If called in scalar context it will return one processed item from the flow.
If called in list context it will return all the elements in the last queue.

=head2 reset

Clears all data in the dataflow and makes it ready for a new run.

=head2 flush

Flushes all the data through the dataflow, and returns the complete result set.

=head2 process

Immediately processes a bunch of data, without touching the object queues. It
will process all the provided data and return the complete result set for it.

=head2 proc_by_index

Expects an index (Num) as parameter. Returns the index-th processor in this
data flow, or C<undef> otherwise.

=head2 proc_by_name

Expects a name (Str) as parameter. Returns the first processor in this
data flow, for which the C<name> attribute has the same value of the C<name>
parameter, or C<undef> otherwise.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 dataflow

Syntax sugar function that can be used to instantiate a new flow. It can be
used like this:

	my $flow = dataflow
		[ 'Proc' => p => sub { ... } ],
		...
		[ 'CSV' => direction => 'CONVERT_TO' ];

	$flow->process('bananas');

=head1 HISTORY

This is a framework for data flow processing. It started as a spin-off project
from the L<OpenData-BR|http://www.opendatabr.org/> initiative.

As of now (Mar, 2011) it is still a 'work in progress', and there is a lot of
progress to make. It is highly recommended that you read the tests, and the
documentation of L<DataFlow::Proc>, to start with.

An article has been recently written in Brazilian Portuguese about this
framework, per the São Paulo Perl Mongers "Equinócio" (Equinox) virtual event.
Although an English version of the article in in the plans, you can figure
a good deal out of the original one at

L<http://sao-paulo.pm.org/equinocio/2011/mar/5>

B<UPDATE:> L<DataFlow> is a fast-evolving project, and this article, as
it was published there, refers to versions 0.91.x of the framework. There has
been a big refactor since then and, although the concept remains the same,
since version 0.950000 the programming interface has been changed violently.

Any doubts, feel free to get in touch.
